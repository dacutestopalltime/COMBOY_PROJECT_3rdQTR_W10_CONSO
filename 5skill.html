   <h3 style="color:#02456A;"><i>The goal of design adaptability is to reuse the same "design" to create different products. 
          As a result, its relevance and importance in the design process are closely related to the ability to 
          create new items with similar designs. Graphic design trends are essential, particularly in branding 
          and marketing. They provide insight into what is currently hot in business, as well as a sense of 
          what will be successful in the marketplace in the future.
