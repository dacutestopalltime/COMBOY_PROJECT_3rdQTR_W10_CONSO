     Pork Menudo is the number one on the list of my comfort foods and it’s hard 
     for me to last a month without trying one…literally. Some would say that I 
     am addicted to this food while others would use the term “obsession”, I just 
     simply look at it as a necessity – a basic necessity that I cannot live without.
