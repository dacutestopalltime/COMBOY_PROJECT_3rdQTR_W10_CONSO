   <h3 style="color:#3E3E3E;"><i>Ideation is a collaborative creative method in which designers produce ideas in sessions. 
          Ideation is the process of creating a large number of thoughts about a specific topic without making 
          any attempt to judge or evaluate them. While the ultimate goal of ideation is to produce a high-quality 
          design that solves a specific problem. DesignersÂ gather with open minds in order to generate as many ideas 
          as possible in response to a problem statement in a supported, judgment-free environment.
