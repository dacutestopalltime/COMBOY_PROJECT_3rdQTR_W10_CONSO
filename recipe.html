<h1> Sinigang </h1>
<h2><i> Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. 
Sinigang means "stewed [dish]", it is a nominalized form of the Tagalog verb sigang, 
"to stew". The soup is usually accommodated by rice. It is one of the most well-known 
Filipino recipe! </i></h2>
<h3> Filipino Sinigang and Vietnamese Canh Chua </h3>
<p> Canh chua, which means sour soup in Vietnamese, is the country's equivalent to <b>Sinigang</b>. 
A lot of the general flavor profile is pretty similar because it is made with the same 
tamarind base, but the Vietnamese version leans more toward the FISHY side than the PORK side.</p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Baboy </h3>
<p> The Filipino dish <b>sinigang</b> na baboy consists of pork and taro cooked in a sour broth. 
Pork belly serves as the primary source of protein in this particular recipe. 
The taste of <b>sinigang</b> na baboy is sour. Pork ribs, veggies, and fresh 
tamarind or tamarind powder are used to make this sour soup. It is warming, delicious, 
and ideal for cold weather. It is also the most popular version of <b>Sinigang</b>. </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Baka </h3>
<p> A delicious version of <b>sinigang</b> is <b>sinigang</b> na baka, or beef <b>sinigang</b>. 
This meal has a lot of positive qualities. You'll enjoy how the sourness of the soup and 
the flavor of the beef blend together. It is fantastic. Fresh vegetables offer delicious flavors. 
You will also enjoy eating the tender beef by grabbing it using your hands, 
just like the way we eat BBQ ribs. It is amazing! </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Bangus </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na Bangus or Milkfish in Sour Broth is an all-time favorite dish of many Filipinos.  
It is a dish made of vegetables boiled in sour broth, cooked until the vegetable 
turn glossy before adding the milkfish.  The sour taste of tamarind juice gives 
the distinctive taste of the broth.  One of the main ingredients is the milkfish. </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Hipon </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na Hipon is a sour dish with shrimp as the main ingredient. 
This dish also contains vegetables like radish, snake beans, okra, 
and eggplant. This dish is best served in cold weather. It is best served hot with a cup of white rice! </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Tilapia </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na Tilapia is a popular Filipino sour fish soup recipe. Since we pan-fried the tilapia beforehand, 
this version is tastier than the usual recipes. It adds an interesting flavor to the dish for some reason! </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Pata </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na PataÂ is a pork hock-based version of <b>sinigang</b> na baboy. Except for the extra preparation required
for the pata, it is similar to our pork <b>sinigang</b> recipe. You'll enjoy how the dish turns out. The pata was extremely 
tender, and the soup was as sour and delicious as expected. It was fantastic! </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Kambing </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na Kambing is a sour soup made from unripe tamarind and goat meat. This dish is similar to 
<b>sinigang</b> and is ideal for eating during the colder months. This <b>Sinigang</b> na Kambing recipe uses goat meat, 
whereas traditional versions use the goat's head and feet. Food should not be wasted, 
which is why all parts of the animal should be consumed. </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> Sinigang na Manok </h3>
<p> <b>Sinigang</b> na Manok is our final version of <b>sinigang</b> today. I know, it's quite surprising and unexpected to 
find Chicken <b>Sinigang</b>! <b>Sinigang</b> na Manok is a sour soup made with chicken, vegetables, and tamarind leaves. 
This recipe for chicken soup is similar to <b>Sinigang</b>. The only difference is that tamarind leaves are used. 
Some argue that <b>Sinigang</b> na Manok is simply another <b>sinigang</b> recipe. However, there are some 
noticeable differences that give each dish its own identity. </p>
